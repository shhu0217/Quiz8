This sketch used colorful concentric circles and radial repetition. I am inspired by its use of layering and dense dot arrangements to form organic, mandala-like visuals. I plan to incorporate this “concentric structure + dot repetition” technique into my final project (Wheels of Fortune), as it aligns with my goal of creating a vibrant, circular, culturally resonant composition. Though originally handmade, this coded simulation provides an accessible digital path to recreate similar effects with interactivity.

### Coding Technique Exploration
**Technique** : *Radial Pattern Generation using Polar Coordinates*

Using polar coordinates and concentric loop logic makes it easier to create radial patterns with even dot spacing and rotation, as seen in the OpenProcessing example. This technique allows me to draw repeated elements around a center point using angle and radius, which is essential for building “wheel-like” motifs. It simplifies complex geometric design into a few nested loops and helps express cultural pattern symmetry digitally.
